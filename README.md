📌 TSP Approximation Solver
An Approximate Solver for the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) using MST-based heuristics.

📝 About
This project implements a 2-Approximation Algorithm for the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) using:
✅ Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) to reduce edge costs
✅ Preorder Depth-First Search (DFS) to generate an approximate tour
✅ Graph visualization with NetworkX & Matplotlib

📂 Features
🏗 Graph Generation: Randomly generates weighted complete graphs
🔍 MST Construction: Uses Prim's/Kruskal’s Algorithm
🏆 TSP Approximation: Implements 2-Approximation Algorithm
📊 Visualization: Displays results with Matplotlib
💡 Future Improvements
🔹 Implement Christofides' 1.5-Approximation Algorithm
🔹 Compare with Brute-Force Exact TSP
🔹 Optimize runtime for large graphs
